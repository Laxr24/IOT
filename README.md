# IOT
This project was a demonstration for a IOT Power controller using Arduino and ESP8266(Wifi Module). The webinterface could Rx/Tx signal realtime from the arduino to the server. 
This project was the bare minimum that explains how an IOT project actually works and how we get to controll our 
smart devices over long distance. ðŸ’˜
